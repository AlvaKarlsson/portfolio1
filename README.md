# Towards Ironman
Towards Ironman is a website for people that want to challenge themselves to complete an Ironman, no matter the distance. Together with one of the coaches, a personal training program is produced to suit the user and their goals. No prices are written out because prizing varies depending on lenght of the program, if the client wants a nutrition guide, help the days following up to the race with packing, nutrition during the race and other things. The absolute pricing is presented when the client and the coach has had a first meeting and talked about how extensive the programme will be.

The site is designed to be intriguing and set a spark of interest for the user to challenge themselves to a bigger goal. They have access to different ways to engage contact to the coaches and a section of thorough information about the programmes and the general structure.
